Instructions for creating a bootable MemTest86 CD.
=========================================================

1) Insert a CD into the CD drive.
2) Use the CD burning software available on your system to create a CD-ROM using the uncompressed ISO image

Be sure that you create a CD image from the ISO file rather than placing a copy of the ISO file onto a data CD. 
Look for “Burn Image from File” or similar option under the File menu of your CD burning software. On a Mac, 
you can use 'Disk Utility'.
